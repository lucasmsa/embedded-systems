# Smart Shower ðŸ’§
The idea was to monitor shower price using an ESP8266 and a flow sensor with firebase integration, reading and writing from its realtime database, calculating the water cost based on the region that the user is,
fbut due to the covid outbreak/isolation of group members the connection with the web app was hardened, so aside from the esp connection part we've made a simple react-native app connecting with the web app through firebase

# How to Run
